# Airports
## By Stone Kaech
This shows the airports in the USA and indicates if they have an air traffic control tower or not.

To create the page there is an onAdd function creating the legend. A style function to style the states on the map and a setColor function to change those state's color. geoJson.ajax creates the airports and their appropriate icon/color.

It uses font-awesome, Leaflet, jquery, and chroma. This data is acquired from USGS and Mike Bostock of D3.
